# :star: Features

[(Back to top)](#next-auth)

This is a project built to study authentication in Next.JS using Next Auth. It
uses Next.JS SSR feature to verify credentials. Permissions are defined between
roles and permissions, so pages can be accessed as such.

Some key features are:

- Functional application with Next.JS.
- Page are render under credentials check with SSR.
- Credentials are saved in Cookies.
- Authentication system made with JWT.
- Token and Refresh Token strategy for auth validation.

The application is built using ReactJS with Next.JS framework and SSR feature.
Auth methods is provided by an API in this [repo](https://github.com/areasflavio/next-auth-server).
The entire codebase is written using Typescript.

> Project developed at Chapter IV of Rocketseat's Ignite bootcamp.
